Phone Suggestion Bot

MOTIVATION - The amount of data present in the form of reviews is humungous, and no human can read and acquire that much knowledge in a systematic way. We aim to build a software automation for the process and develop a product that can use all its knowledge acquired from the reviews to make suggestions to humans

ABSTRACT - We are building a chatbot that would suggest the best phones according to the user interaction. The model we plan to 
implement would look like a sales person/shopkeeper responding at the other end in the best case. We would be scraping data from the
multiple e-commerce sites and make a database on which we would make our suggestions. On the data obtained from the various
sites we would apply data analytics to mine opinions about specific features of the phone. We would also use sentiment analysis
on the reviews, along with the user ratings on the reviews to compute a parameter that gives us a continuous score distribution
for every phone in our database. This score would be used by the chatbot to give suggestions for the phone. The chatbot would
be rule based to begin with and would proceed to incorporate advanced NLP and ML features as we develop.
